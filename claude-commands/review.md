# Code review

As a senior software engineer, review the current changes. Look for:

- Potential bugs or issues
- Performance
- Security
- Correctness

If issues are found, list them in a few short bullet points. Start each bullet point with a 🐛. Each bullet should be separated by a blank line.

Keep your response concise.
